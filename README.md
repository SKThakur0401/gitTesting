# gitTesting

This is the readme of my gitTesting repository, a repository is like a folder,
There are 2 steps of making changes in a file , first is "add" 2nd is "commit" 

git config --local user.name "Saumya Kumar Thakur"
git config --local user.email "saumyakumarthakurp@gmail.com"

9560097565 8674810785 9470987825 8447998650

I am adding a new line here (for the sake of changes)

(After making changes when u do "git status" it will include this folder in the list of folders in which changes are made)
