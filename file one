GIT is a version control system : which means it is used to store changes made in a code as well as remember time at which those changes were made etc (Like a bank remembers all our financial transactions), it remembers the previous versions of the code and u can update code by making a "commit"

GITHUB is a website linked with GIT, github creates a "remote repository" on the internet, which you can allow others to access via link or public repos can be seen by anyone

Your computer or VS-Code is your "local Repository" and the data present on internet on "github" is your "remote repository" whose link u use to show your projects on resume



This is a text file created by me


git config --global user.name "My_name"
git config --global user.email "My_email"

git config --list       #This will display all the configurations u have done above

# Now create a folder and use "git clone _link_of_repo_u_wanna_copy_in_this_folder"
git clone https_link

# After this, git will create a folder within our folder having the entire code from that repo, now enter that folder and use "git status" to check the status, 
# This status will tell whether u have made any changes in git or not,

git status                               # To check the status, it shows "modified" if changes are made in a file and shows "untracked file" when new files are created

# Now I am going to make changes in this file, now when we do "git status" we will see this as modified

# Now, when we do " git add README.md  " , it will "stage" the changes, which can be "commited" later,      there are two steps of saving file changes:
    # First is "add" which will "stage" the changes, 2nd is commit which will save the changes and store it in permanent memory, u can see any of your previously commited forms of a project via history, while commiting, it is adviced to write a "msg" to remember which commit had added which functionality

    # now after u have done {   git commit -m "whatever msg u want with this commit"    }
    # Even now changes wouldn't be saved on your github website, and if u do "git status" it will tell u your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' , it means, that the changes are "commited" on the local repository!! Its not yet implemented on the "remote repository" (Which is the github website) , so to do that, u have to type "git push origin main"        then it will implemented on the "remote repository" now necessary changes are implemented on the github :)

    Here "origin" is the name of the "remote repository" on which changes will be incurred when we make changes here,  and "main" refers to the main branch as we are currently working on the main branch

    # Question: How to find whether a folder is linked to GITHUB?
    # Answer  : just press "  ls -a  " in that folder if you see a " .git " file, means it is linked to github :)
